Key Features:

Data Visualization: Presents CrUX data in a clear and interactive table format.
Data Filtering and Sorting: Allows users to filter data based on specific metrics and thresholds, as well as sort data by columns.
Multi-URL Support: Enables users to enter multiple URLs and view their respective performance metrics in a consolidated dashboard.
Data Summarization: Calculates and displays averages and sums of relevant metrics to provide insights into overall user experience trends.
Target Audience:

Developers, data analysts, and website owners who want to track and optimize user experience across their web properties.
Installation and Usage:

(Provide detailed instructions on how to install and run the application, including any required dependencies or setup steps.)

Technologies Used:

(List the programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and data sources used in the project.)
Contributing:

(Provide guidelines for contributing code or documentation, if applicable.)

License:

(Specify the license under which the project is released.)

Additional Information:

Data Source: The CrUX dataset is publicly available through the Chrome UX Report API.
Project Structure: (Outline the main components of the project, such as data fetching, data processing, UI components, etc.)
Usage Examples: (Provide illustrative examples of how to use the dashboard for different tasks.)
Known Limitations or Issues: (Acknowledge any current limitations or potential issues that users should be aware of.)
Future Enhancements:

(List potential features or improvements planned for future iterations of the project.)
I'm ready to assist with further refinements as you provide more specifics about the project's implementation and features.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
